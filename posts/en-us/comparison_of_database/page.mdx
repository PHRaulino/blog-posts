   title: 'Comparison of Database Query Methods: Performance Analysis using SQLAlchemy'
   description: 'The post discusses a study comparing four database query methods using SQLAlchemy. The best performance is achieved with the third method, which executes raw SQL and converts results into a dictionary.'
---

## Objective

The study aimed to evaluate different methods of querying a database to find all lists without tasks. For this purpose, three tables were created, and 1000 Lists, 1 Task Type, and 1000 Tasks were randomly inserted into the lists.

Next, four different query methods were tested, using the timeit library to measure the execution time of each of them.

## First Method

The first query method used in the study involved fetching all tasks using the database session and then filtering the result using a for loop and an if statement to retrieve only the lists without tasks.

When measuring the execution time of this method using the timeit library, the following results were obtained:

- 80.31528 seconds in 10,000 executions
- 8.45821 seconds in 1,000 executions
- 1.13667 seconds in 100 executions

These results show that, although the method is functional, it is quite inefficient for large amounts of data, as the execution time is very high.

```python
model = table.get_model("Table")

lists = db.query(model).all()

[
    list_model
    for list_model in lists
    if len(list(list_model.lists_tasks_types)) == 0
]
```

## Second Method

The second query method used in the study involved creating a subquery and using it as a filter for the main query using the SQLAlchemy ORM.

The results obtained with this method were significantly better than the results of the first method, which used a for loop to filter lists without tasks. The following are the execution times in seconds for this method:

- 39.21246 seconds in 10,000 executions
- 3.86407 seconds in 1,000 executions
- 0.40279 seconds in 100 executions

The results show that this method is more efficient than the first one, as it uses a subquery to pre-select lists without tasks, reducing the volume of data to be processed in the main query.

```python
model = table.get_model("Table")

subquery = (
    db.query(model.id_list)
    .join(ListTaskTypeModel)
    .join(TaskModel)
    .group_by(model.id_list)
    .having(func.count(TaskModel.id_task) > 0)
    .subquery()
)

# Select lists that are not in the subquery
lists_without_tasks = (
    db.query(model)
    .outerjoin(ListTaskTypeModel)
    .outerjoin(TaskModel)
    .filter(model.id_list.notin_(subquery))
    .all()
)
```

## Third Method

The third method used in the study involved using a raw SQL query executed directly on the database and transforming the result into a dictionary.

The results of this method were better than the results of the second method, which used the SQLAlchemy ORM with a subquery. The following are the execution times in seconds for this method:

- 5.95166 seconds in 10,000 executions
- 0.59906 seconds in 1,000 executions
- 0.06127 seconds in 100 executions

The results indicate that this method is even more efficient than the second method, as it uses a raw SQL query, which is generally faster than the ORM, and then transforms the result into a dictionary, which is a lighter data structure than ORM objects.

```python
result = db.execute(query).cursor
col_names = [desc[0] for desc in result.description]
return cursor_to_dict(col_names, result)
```

## Fourth Method

The fourth method used in the study involved creating a cursor with the database engine directly in the DBManager class, which creates sessions, and executing a raw SQL query using this cursor. Then, the result was transformed into a dictionary.

The results of this method were slightly worse than the results of the third method, which used a raw SQL query with the execute method of the SQLAlchemy ORM. The following are the execution times in seconds for this method:

- 7.13930 seconds in 10,000 executions
- 0.71640 seconds in 1,000 executions
- 0.07325 seconds in 100 executions

The results indicate that this method is slightly less efficient than the third method, probably because it creates a cursor with the database engine instead of using the execute function of the SQLAlchemy ORM. However, the execution times are still quite good compared to the first and second methods.

```python
with database.engine.connect() as db:
    result = db.execute(query).cursor
    col_names = [desc[0] for desc in result.description]
    resultado = cursor_to_dict(col_names, result)
return resultado
```

## Conclusion

Method 3 is the fastest because it makes a direct query to the database using the `execute` method of SQLAlchemy. By doing so, it avoids the overhead of using the ORM and creating unnecessary objects in memory, which can consume resources and slow down the query.

Additionally, Method 3 returns a cursor, which is a low-level structure for accessing query results, and converts these results into a dictionary. This allows the query to be executed more efficiently, and the results to be handled more flexibly.

By avoiding the use of the ORM, Method 3 also allows queries to be more optimized and maximizes the performance of the database, especially in more complex queries or with large volumes of data. For these reasons, Method 3 may be the best choice for queries that require high efficiency and performance.
